# Data Analysis and Factors Affecting Birth Rates in the US

This repository focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to Toronto Public Transportation Delay. Through an analysis of trends spanning from 1980 to 2020, we investigate variations in birth rates among different age groups and disparities based on the race and ethnicity of mothers. While initially attributing the decline to the Great Recession, our analysis uncovers additional factors contributing to this trend. 

## Reproducibility

### Dependencies
To reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following polar packages installed:

- `ggplot2`
- 'gridExtra'
- 'dplyr'
- 'tidyr'

You can install these packages using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra","dplyr","tidyr"))
```

### Code Execution
The analysis is performed in R, and the code is available in the `analysis` directory. To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries.
2. Read the cleaned data from the CSV file.
3. Perform data filtering and manipulation for specific analyses.
4. Generate tables and graphs to visualize trends.
